# libr3d coverage plan

Sources: radiance v1.8.1 — `docs/PLUGIN.md` §10, `docs/OPS.md`, `arch/common/*` (the op set a
bf16 dense model issues), `core/` (the sampler ops the engine issues), `libref/` (the oracle).

## Ground rules

- Every op in the conventional vocabulary has a libref host fallback and a kbench oracle. Every
  kernel we ship is checked against libref with `rad-kbench` on recorded geometries before it is
  considered done.
- Ops `docs/OPS.md` marks **device-only** have no oracle; they are deferred and will need
  hand-written validation.
- Partial coverage is legal: unresolved ops are errors only if issued. An incomplete libr3d
  simply doesn't serve models whose op set it hasn't reached.
- RDNA3 has no native fp8 (E4M3) hardware. fp8/w4a8/fused-quant rows are out of scope until the
  bf16 path works; when they come, expect conversion-at-boundary designs, not emulated MMA.

## Tier 0 — load smoke (this skeleton)

Zero rows. Plugin loads on gfx11, ABI 22 accepted, selection unchanged.
Check: `rad-info --plugins` on the card.

## Tier 1 — bf16 minimum viable model (goal: decode a 2B-class bf16 model on RDNA3)

Model ops issued by the bf16 dense path (`arch/common/rad_block_attn*.h`, `rad_block_mlp.h`,
`rad_arch.h`):

| op            | role                                   | notes |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|-------|
| embed_lookup  | token -> row                            | trivial gather |
| gemm_nt       | qkv / gate+up / down / lm_head          | the big one: wave32 WMMA bf16 on gfx11 |
| rmsnorm       | pre-attn / pre-mlp / final              | |
| rope          | rotary positions                        | neox + default variants |
| attn_paged    | decode + prefill attention              | second big one; per head_dim/gqa geometry |
| kv_store      | append to paged KV cache                | |
| act (silu_mul)| SwiGLU activation-multiply               | confirm exact op name/graph via --debug-graph |
| cast          | dtype edges                             | |
| all_reduce    | TP only                                 | Tier 2 (TP1 needs no collective) |

Sampler ops issued by core (`sample_*`), ~11 in the default chain:
`sample_temp, sample_topk, sample_topp, sample_minp, sample_typical, sample_penalties,
sample_dry, sample_xtc, sample_mask, sample_merge_topk, sample_pick, sample_argmax,
sample_logprobs` — exact served subset to be confirmed with `--debug-graph` on the card.

## Tier 2 — multi-rank and shapes

`all_reduce` / `all_gather` (+ `_host` twins — consumer P2P needs them even on RDNA4, so the
design is proven), wider head_dim/gqa geometries, prefill tiles.

## Tier 3 — quantised vocabulary

fp8 GEMM families via boundary conversion (OCP E4M3 bytes per the core's convention), i8a8,
w4a16-style weight formats that avoid fp8 MMA. Device-only fused ops: last, with bespoke tests.

## Verification loop (per kernel)

1. `docker` build of libr3d against pinned radiance (no card).
2. Host-tier tests (`ctest -LE 'gpu|oot'` upstream patterns; kbench fixture tier).
3. On rdna3-dev with the RDNA3 card: `rad-kbench` vs libref over recorded geometries, red-zone OOB;
   then `rad-info --plugins`; then serve MiniCPM5-2B bf16.

## Verified state on hardware (gfx1100, RX 7900 XTX class, rdna3-dev ROCR index 0)

2026-10-19, radiance-dev:v1.8.1 (radiance v1.8.1, ROCm 10.1):

- **Load gate:** `rad-info --plugins` on `--home build/radiance_home` reports
  `libr3d 0.1.0 kernels 1 kernel(s), 1 schema(s)` against `AQL backend, 1 device(s)
  [0:gfx1100]`, exit 0. The fat binary's gfx11-generic code objects load on gfx1100.
- **Oracle gate:** `rmsnorm_bf16` vs libref on the card: **90 checked, 90 passed,
  worst rel_l2 2.395e-04**, 40 cases in guarded allocations with 0 OOB writes, over the
  741-case fixture recorded from qwen3.8-27b-fp8.

Reproduce (on rdna3-dev, after `cmake --build build`):

```
docker run --rm --device /dev/kfd --device /dev/dri --group-add video \
  -v $PWD:/work -e ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 radiance-dev:v1.8.1 bash -lc '
  mkdir -p /tmp/home/kernels /tmp/home/architectures &&
  cp /opt/radiance/share/radiance/kernels/libref.so \
     /work/build/radiance_home/kernels/libr3d.so /tmp/home/kernels/ &&
  rad-kbench --home /tmp/home --fixture /opt/radiance/share/radiance/kernels.rkb --op rmsnorm'
```

Pitfalls this settled:
- A loaded kernel plugin must declare the schema of every op it implements; libref is a
  kbench oracle, not a search-path plugin, so on RDNA3 libr3d declares its ops' schemas
  itself, copied verbatim from libr4d so co-load `schema_same()` passes.
- The search path requires `architectures/` to exist beside `kernels/` (empty is fine).
- On rdna3-dev the 7900 is ROCR index **0** (`[0:gfx1100 1:gfx1201 2:gfx1201]`), not DRM card1.
- kbench needs ~3 GiB free in the container; case budget auto-shrinks and names skips.
